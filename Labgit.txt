1.First of all, install git if you don't have it yet, and create a GitHub account. ( You can refer to the lesson "Install Git and Create GitHub Account" in the prework. Follow the guidelines given there. Additionally, you can use these resources: Install git, Version control with git)

2.Create a new repository in the GitHub. Name it Iron+ your name. Example: if your name is Alvaro, you will name the repo IronAlvaro.
I chose  my repositories and then create new after that I created a new repo with the name ironnikos 

3.Clone that repo to your computer.
in BASH I wrote "git clone https://github.com/phenomenonnk/ironnikos.git"

4.Create a file in that folder. Name it about.txt and add a fun fact about yourself. (You can use the command line: touch nameOfTheFile.txt).
In bash
'touch about.txt'
'echo "I dance" >>about.txt'


5.Add the file you just created to the git.
git add .

6.Commit the changes.
git commit -m 'changes'

7.Push the changes to the GitHub and check your repository to make sure everything is there.
git push

Pair Programming Exercise
1.Fork your classmate's repository.
my classmate sent me the URL of his repo and the I chose the button fork


2.Clone the repository, so that you have it locally and can make changes.
In BASH I wrote 'git clone https://github.com/phenomenonnk/ironTottas.git'

3.Create a new branch named classmate.
I created a new branch named 'classmate' using the Github webpage interface

4.Create a new file with your name (ex. maya.txt) and finish the following sentence I enrolled Ironhack's Data Analytics bootcamp because.... When you are done, save the changes.
I changed the branch to 'classmate' using the command 'git checkout classmate'

Admin@DESKTOP-9N9UGQ5 MINGW64 ~/desktop/Labs/lab-git/ironTottas (classmate)
$ touch nikos.txt
Admin@DESKTOP-9N9UGQ5 MINGW64 ~/desktop/Labs/lab-git/ironTottas (classmate)
$ echo "I enrolled Ironhack's Data Analytics bootcamp because I would like to change my carrer" >>nikos.txt


5.Add the changes to the git.
Admin@DESKTOP-9N9UGQ5 MINGW64 ~/desktop/Labs/lab-git/ironTottas (classmate)
$ git add .
warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in nikos.txt.
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory


6.Commit and push the changes. Now, all the changes should be on your GitHub, inside the forked repository.
Admin@DESKTOP-9N9UGQ5 MINGW64 ~/desktop/Labs/lab-git/ironTottas (classmate)
$ git commit -m 'changes to classmate branch'
[classmate 7ddbaab] changes to classmate branch
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)

7.Create a pull request to make changes appear in the original repository.

8.Merge the branch your classmate created. Now everyone's repos should have the original file (about.txt) as well as the new one with your classmate's name.
